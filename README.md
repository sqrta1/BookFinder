Hello, there!

This is my [Book Finder] project which I wrote on React.js.
There are plenty of functions, such as: sort by relevance/newest, sort by categories, click on element and u'll be able to see Big Element with it's description, load more etc.
https://developers.google.com/books/docs/v1/using <- API used to get books.
I hope you enjoy!
